&nbsp;
&nbsp;
一
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
I couldn’t
have been more wrong.
I thought
that I could smile, nod my way thought it.
Pretend like
it would all be ok.


&nbsp;
I had a
plan.
I wanted to
change who I was.
Create a lift
as someone new.
Someone
without the past.
Without the
pain.
Someone
alive.
&nbsp;
But it’s not
that easy.
The bad
things stay with you.
They follow
you.
You can’t
escape them.
As much as
you want to.
&nbsp;
All you can
do is be ready for the good.
So when it
comes.
You invite it
in, because you need it.
I need
it.
