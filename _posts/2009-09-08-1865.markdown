&nbsp; I’m already arrived at India for a long time . Arrived in
India this time people are very restless. Whenever I meet upset
things started to miss my home. Maybe I think the home is real
warmth place. Yes, today I’m single. Yes , I am not happy. Maybe it
is a another begin. I'm just worried about it that I make a big
deal to prepare gifts nobody receives. Maybe it will be rubbish
,yes I do .Yes maybe only worried about this. This is really a bad
weather, bad mood, bad⋯
&nbsp; Tomorrow is another day!
